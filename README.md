# A-new-charismatic-monkey-frog
Scripts and morphometric and bioacoustic datasets used for the statistical analyses in the scientific article describing the monkey frog species Pithecopus gonzagai (https://europeanjournaloftaxonomy.eu/index.php/ejt/article/view/1147). The main objective of this project was to classify individuals of the studied species based on morphometric data, using a multivariate approach, machine learning and traditional parametric techniques. Additionally, we tested for significant differences with a univariate approach and permutation statistics.

In the datasets I uploaded, the "locality" column includes five categories (=species): "hypo" (P. hypochondrialis), "araguaius" (P. araguaius), "azureus" (P. azureus), "nordestinus" (P. nordestinus), and "franciscus" (P. gonzagai). The remaining columns contain morphometric variables.

R language. Packages used: coin, randomForest, rfPermute, MVN, and adegenet.
